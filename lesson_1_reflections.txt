it ws much easier than searching in the entire text

I can easily get, see and modify my current file based on the changes i've made to it
and it's history

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you can divide the code commited into logical pieces of code, that make up an entire
request, if nit too big. 
Cons: G. Docs for example saves automatically and you have no control on the size of the new version,
no description for the save(to state the reason) and different versions can be too big, for example,
or too small, if nothing substantial had been modified.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
