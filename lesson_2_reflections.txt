?What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Run git init, so the git system will be initualized in the specified folder

?How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It's an intermediate area where you can add or delete files without commiting them,
thus allowing you to create a commit after you're all set!
