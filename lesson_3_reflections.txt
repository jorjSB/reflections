?When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I can see no case in which I wouldn't want to keep my files remotely also, for backup purposes. 
The only disadvantage is that those would be public on the github's free account.

?Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because Others people working on the same branch might add something I don't want yet in my local copy, conflicts may appear etc.. 

?Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - clones only on GitHub! 
Clones - clone an entire repository!
Branches - Labels for fifferent commmits, can be seen as different branches that can be kept separated or can be merged together

?What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That I can make changes to it, modif it and so on, without affecting the remote branch.

?How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/Hub I would use mail or some messaging app, upload code, links etc.. That would be very hard for reviewing any code change and collaboration.

?When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When multiple people work on the same project it's a good ideea to work on a separate branch, so nothing goes to origin/master directly. This allows a lot of flexibility for changes, code review made simpler etc.
