?When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I can see no case in which I wouldn't want to keep my files remotely also, for backup purposes. 
The only disadvantage is that those would be public on the github's free account.

?Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because Others people working on the same branch might add something I don't want yet in my local copy, conflicts may appear etc..
