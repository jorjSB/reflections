?When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I can see no case in which I wouldn't want to keep my files remotely also, for backup purposes. 
The only disadvantage is that those would be public on the github's free account.

?Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because Others people working on the same branch might add something I don't want yet in my local copy, conflicts may appear etc.. 

?Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - clones only on GitHub! 
Clones - clone an entire repository!
Branches - Labels for fifferent commmits, can be seen as different branches that can be kept separated or can be merged together

?What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That I can make changes to it, modif it and so on, without affecting the remote branch.
